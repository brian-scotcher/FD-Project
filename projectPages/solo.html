    <p>Young Han Solo finds adventure when he joins forces with a gang of galactic smugglers and a

    plan to travel to the mining planet Kessel to steal a batch of valuable coaxium. In need of a fast 
    ship, Solo meets Lando Calrissian, the suave owner of the perfect vessel for the dangerous mission 
    -- the Millennium Falcon. - Source:Google</p>
